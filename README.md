# Not Echofon

**Not Echofon** is not **Echofon**.

This project is a fork from the defunct *Echofon for Firefox*[Â¶](http://www.echofon.com/twitter/firefox/) to try and maintain its compatibility with the Twitter API.

It works fine with current version `1.1` of Twitter's API.

## Is this affiliated with Echofon?

No.

## Are they OK with this fork?

They [don't give a sh*t](http://notechofon.github.io/notechofon/images/legal.png).

## How to install ?

Just `git clone` this repo in your Firefox / user profile / extension directory

## I have a feature request or bug to report

Fork, implement / fix and open a pull request
